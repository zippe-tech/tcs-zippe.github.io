        <h1>Zippe Transport Ltd - Driver Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 1, 2023</p>

        <h2>Scope of Services</h2>
        <p>Zippe provides a digital platform accessed via the Zippe Driver App and the Zippe Passenger App, that allows Zippe to accept requests from Passengers for transport services and then make these requests available through the Driver App, for Drivers to accept or decline such a request and have the option of fulfilling any such requests directly with the Passengers (together, the "<strong>Software Services</strong>").</p>

        <p>Zippe agrees to provide the Software Services to you for use in accordance with these Driver Terms. The transportation services that you provide to passengers through the App shall be referred to in these Driver Terms as "<strong>Trips</strong>".</p>

        <p>The Trips are carried out by you as a worker on behalf of Zippe with the Passenger. You are free to provide passenger transport services at your discretion independently from these Driver Terms, including using other software services, whether competitive with Zippe or otherwise.</p>

        <p>You are responsible for providing all equipment necessary to perform the Trips, and all associated costs with the provision of Trips shall be borne by the Driver. This includes but is not limited to costs such as the vehicle, fuel, insurance, mobile phone/device and associated data usage plans to access and use the Driver App.</p>

        <p>Zippe’s provision for the invitation or acceptance of Trips is made under Zippe's PHV Operator’s License(s) issued by Local Authorities in accordance with the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 ("<strong>Operating License</strong>").</p>

        <h2>Becoming a Driver</h2>
        <p>As part of the registration process, you will need to supply Zippe with information about yourself, your driving and PHV license, your vehicle (including insurance), and other information requested by Zippe in order to assess your suitability to use the Driver App. Zippe may verify this information and in this respect, where required by applicable law or regulations, you provide your specific consent to Zippe seeking this verification. Please see clause 15 of these Driver Terms and Conditions.</p>

        <p>It is your responsibility to ensure any information we hold for your Driver account is accurate and up to date at all times.</p>

        <p>By registering for a Driver Account, you confirm that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>a)</strong> You can legally enter into an agreement with Zippe to use the Software Services.</li>
            <li><strong>b)</strong> You have, and will continue to have, the right to work in the United Kingdom (including holding a valid National Insurance Number).</li>
            <li><strong>c)</strong> You have carefully read, fully understand, and agree to be bound by these Driver Terms, including all the obligations imposed on you by these Driver Terms.</li>
            <li><strong>d)</strong> Once your application is accepted, you will not authorise any other person to use your account nor transfer it to any other person.</li>
            <li><strong>e)</strong> You have and will continue to have all the necessary licences, insurances, road tax, and authorisations to provide the Trips under these Driver Terms.</li>
            <li><strong>f)</strong> You will, at all times while providing Trips, have appropriate and valid insurance for your vehicle type.</li>
            <li><strong>g)</strong> You are, and will at all times be, medically fit to operate a motor vehicle and shall not engage in reckless behaviour while driving, including driving unsafely, operating a vehicle that is unsafe to drive, permitting an unauthorised third party to accompany you in the vehicle while providing Trips, providing Trips while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or taking action that harms or threatens to harm the safety of passengers or third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>h)</strong> You will not use the app for unauthorised or unlawful purposes or impair or seek to impair the proper operation of the Driver app.</li>
            <li><strong>i)</strong> You will not copy or distribute the Software or other Zippe content without prior written permission from Zippe.</li>
            <li><strong>j)</strong> You acknowledge that Zippe will process your personal data in accordance with Zippe's Privacy Policy available from the <a href="https://nwilson-zippe.github.io/privacy-policy-zippe.github.io/" target="_blank">Website</a> and in the Driver App.</li>
            <li><strong>k)</strong> You understand that Zippe will provide information regarding you, your Driver account, and your Trip history to law enforcement agencies as Zippe deems it appropriate to do so in cooperation with investigations or otherwise.</li>
            <li><strong>l)</strong> All the information presented to Zippe by you is, and shall continue to be, accurate, correct, and complete.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once accepted as a Zippe Driver, you shall not either directly or indirectly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>a)</strong> Engage in any conduct that damages the reputation or causes inconvenience in any manner to Zippe; or</li>
            <li><strong>b)</strong> Be the reason for Zippe to be a part of any negative publicity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Zippe requires the Driver to affix Zippe branding including but not limited to its logo/sticker on their Vehicle when carrying a passenger who has booked a trip through the Zippe Passenger App. The Driver will not be entitled to any additional payments for displaying the Zippe logo/affixed sticker on their Vehicle.</p>

        <p>Zippe will continually monitor your compliance with these Driver Terms, including verifying your licences, insurance, and other information (with third parties if necessary).</p>

        <p>You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>a)</strong> Cooperate with Zippe and provide any further documents or information requested in order for Zippe to conduct such checks; and</li>
            <li><strong>b)</strong> Promptly disclose to Zippe any material changes in your circumstances that relate to your ability, fitness, or legal entitlement to offer or perform Trips or ability to comply with these Driver Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, but without limitation, this will include any revocation of your Driver’s license, refusal of insurance, changes to your eligibility for a hackney carriage or private hire licence, and criminal investigation, charges, or convictions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Should you fail to comply with any of the requirements and/or conditions set out in these Driver Terms, Zippe will be entitled to immediately terminate these Driver Terms with you, in which case you will no longer be permitted to use the app.</p>

        <h2>Zippe Driver App</h2>
        <p>Upon agreeing to comply with these Driver Terms, Zippe agrees to allow you to access and use the Software Services in accordance with these Driver Terms and the Zippe Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>You may not transfer or sub-license this right to use the Software Services.</p>

        <p>In order to use the app, you must log in to your account in the Driver App and update your Driver Profile. You confirm that you will keep this profile up to date at all times.</p>

        <p>You are responsible for all information posted on, and use of the app, from your personal account. If you suspect that your account has been accessed by anyone else, you must notify Zippe immediately.</p>

        <p>Zippe will have the sole authority under its Operating License to make provisions for the invitation or acceptance of Trip requests from Passengers (through the Zippe Passenger App). Once Zippe has accepted a Trip request from a Passenger, Zippe will then seek to dispatch this Trip request to the passenger's closest Driver (geographically). If the closest Driver does not acknowledge the Trip offer within a set timeframe or declines to fulfil the Trip for whatever reason, the booking will then be re-dispatched to the next closest Driver (and so on). It will be up to Zippe to terminate an accepted request for a Trip with a Passenger if it cannot successfully dispatch a Driver to the relevant Trip. Once you have accepted a Trip through the Driver App, all the relevant Trip information will appear on your Driver App, including Passenger details and the pick-up point.</p>

        <p>Zippe will use the Driver App to communicate with you in relation to possible Trips you may or may not wish to agree to provide to Passengers within a set proximity to your current location and also send you messages and restrict pick-up areas as per your licence jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>In order to prioritize Driver and Passenger safety, Zippe may (at its discretion) limit your access to the Driver App when you have been providing trips for extended periods.</p>

        <p>If Zippe is made aware that your behaviour has deviated from our Driver Terms, or that you are under investigation for a criminal offence, Zippe reserves the right to take action by revoking your access to your Driver account indefinitely or until Zippe sees fit.</p>

        <p>Zippe will, at all times, retain control and management of the Software Services (including dispatch services) in order to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>a)</strong> Accept and manage trip requests as set out in these Driver Terms.</li>
            <li><strong>b)</strong> Monitor Driver and vehicle profiles.</li>
            <li><strong>c)</strong> Monitor the status and trip details for any vehicle using the app at any given time.</li>
            <li><strong>d)</strong> Provide support services in respect of dispatching.</li>
            <li><strong>e)</strong> Reject certain Passengers if their accounts are in arrears; and</li>
            <li><strong>f)</strong> Address complaints and lost property issues including liaising with law enforcement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <p>All intellectual property rights to the Driver App, its content, and any related documentation existing anywhere belong to Zippe (and are protected by copyright and/or trade secret laws and other international treaty provisions) and may not be copied, distributed, uploaded, republished, decompiled, disassembled, or transmitted in any way without Zippe’s prior written consent. You will not have any rights of ownership in the Software, its content, or any related documents.</p>

        <h2>Trip Requests</h2>
        <p>Zippe will accept Passenger requests for trips and then notify you via the Driver App if a relevant Passenger request has been generated for a trip in the area when you are available "online".</p>

        <p>You are not obliged to accept any trip requests. Zippe encourages you to keep your profile 'online' when you are available to accept trips and 'offline' when you are not available. This enables the system to dispatch trip requests in the most efficient way for both Drivers and Passengers.</p>

        <p>Zippe does not guarantee that the use of the app will result in you receiving offers to accept trips. Many variables such as, but not limited to, your location, vehicle type, and Passenger demand will affect the likelihood of you being allocated a trip request.</p>

        <p>Upon acceptance of a trip request via the Driver App, Zippe shall provide the Passenger with Driver details including the Vehicle Registration, Vehicle Description, Driver name, and Driver profile picture to enable the Passenger to identify the Driver.</p>

        <p>Cancelling a trip which you have accepted should only be necessary under very exceptional circumstances as you are able to view trip destinations before accepting a trip via the Driver App. Driver cancellation of an accepted trip without explanation to Zippe of such exceptional circumstances will result in the Driver being charged a "<strong>Driver Cancellation Fee</strong>" as detailed in Zippe's Cancellation Policy. Zippe will monitor the number and frequency of trips you cancel and reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the app where you repeatedly, or consistently, cancel trips after you have accepted them.</p>

        <p>As part of the Software Services, Passengers may provide feedback on you and your provision of the trips in the form of ratings. These ratings are made available to prospective Passengers as part of Zippe’s Passenger App. You should contact Zippe if you have any issues with the ratings left for you. As and when necessary, Zippe shall provide you with assistance including steps to consider taking to help you maintain good Passenger feedback and ratings.</p>

        <h2>Identification of Passengers</h2>
        <p>Upon arriving at a pick-up point, before starting a Trip, you must verify that you are providing the trip to the correct Passenger as shown in the Driver App (or that the Passenger has expressly confirmed that they allow the Passenger to use their account).</p>

        <p>If you have made a mistake in identifying a Passenger, and the Fare (as defined in clause 9) is charged to a person who has not been provided or has not approved the trip, Zippe shall reimburse the Passenger for the fare paid. In such case, you shall not be entitled to receive your payment (as defined in clause 11) for this trip. For the avoidance of doubt, the Zippe Fee (as defined in clause 10) for that trip will still be retained by Zippe.</p>

        <h2>Your Commitment to Passengers</h2>
        <p>As a Driver, you commit to each Passenger that you will provide a high level of Passenger service in respect of the trips which you agree to provide. In order to maintain Zippe’s reputation with a view to creating a successful solution for Drivers and Passengers, Zippe monitors your activity on the Driver App. In the course of you providing the Trips, you commit to the Passengers that you will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>a)</strong> Provide the service to all Passengers in a courteous, effective, and timely manner.</li>
            <li><strong>b)</strong> Convey the Passenger from their pickup point to their destination in a reasonably direct and efficient manner.</li>
            <li><strong>c)</strong> Have and maintain valid insurance in the applicable jurisdiction for providing Passenger transportation services.</li>
            <li><strong>d)</strong> At all times be medically fit to operate a motor vehicle, including being free from the influence of alcohol or drugs.</li>
            <li><strong>e)</strong> Not engage in reckless behaviour while driving or driving unsafely, including by operating a vehicle that is unsafe or illegal to drive or allowing a third party to operate the vehicle.</li>
            <li><strong>f)</strong> Act in a professional manner in accordance with the business ethics applicable to providing Passenger transportation and endeavour to perform the Passenger’s request in the best interest of the Passenger.</li>
            <li><strong>g)</strong> Comply with all laws and regulations applicable.</li>
            <li><strong>h)</strong> Not carry weapons (or permit weapons in your vehicle), use or encourage violence, racism, or discrimination in any form; and</li>
            <li><strong>i)</strong> Only use personal data provided by the Passenger in accordance with clause 15 of these Driver Terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You are deemed to be informed and shall also strive to stay informed about conditions such as traffic disruptions, weather conditions, and the like that could affect the Service. You shall contact Zippe about any issues that you may become aware of that are likely to cause major disruption to Zippe services.</p>

        <p>Upon acceptance of a trip request where a Passenger has specified a pick-up time in the future, you agree to arrive at the pick-up point no later than the requested pick-up time.</p>

        <p>You acknowledge that Zippe has no control over Passengers. Zippe shall have no responsibility or liability with respect to how Passengers use your services, including delays or damage to persons or property.</p>

        <p>You commit to report to Zippe any event out of the ordinary which occurs during the trip. Zippe shall keep a record of all trip bookings, complaints, and lost property.</p>

        <p>Driver cancellation of accepted trips is prohibited except in exceptional circumstances based on a justifiable explanation provided by the Driver. The Driver shall immediately inform Zippe in case of any cancellation of an accepted trip. Further, the Driver hereby agrees such cancellation may lead to a Driver cancellation fee.</p>

        <p>You agree that any complaint(s) by passengers regarding the Vehicle or Driver will be considered to be a breach of the obligations by the Driver for which Zippe shall not be responsible in any manner. If there is any serious complaint regarding any particular Vehicle and/or Driver, Zippe may, in its sole discretion, immediately terminate the Account of such Driver, by providing a written notice to the Driver to this effect.</p>

        <h2>Fares</h2>
        <p>You agree that the Zippe app will collect all fares on your behalf for each completed trip you provide to a Passenger through the Passenger App ("<strong>Fare</strong>").</p>

        <p>The actual fare for each trip provided by you will be determined by the Driver App, having regard to the actual trip time, any peak pricing (if applicable), and distance travelled.</p>

        <p>A Passenger may request a trip option that allows them to agree to a Fixed Fare for a specific duration ("<strong>Rental Fare</strong>"). The Rental Fare allows the Passenger to request your services for a set duration and mileage. The Fare calculated in accordance with section 9.2 shall be applied instead of the Rental Fare if the Passenger changes, the trip takes materially longer than estimated due to traffic or other factors, or when other unexpected circumstances impact the characteristics of the trip materially (e.g., a route is used where tolls apply).</p>

        <p>Zippe recommends you use the in-app navigation to complete all trips. You commit to each Passenger that you will provide the trip in accordance with clause 8.1 and otherwise in accordance with these Driver Terms. Where any trip you completed did not comply with these Driver Terms, Zippe reserves the right to deduct any refunds or compensation offered by Zippe to the affected Passenger(s) from your payments.</p>

        <p>A Passenger may cancel a request for a trip that a Driver has accepted via the app. The Driver is entitled to a payment for a cancelled trip ("<strong>Cancellation Fee</strong>") in the event that a Passenger cancels an accepted request for a trip after a certain time period determined by the app.</p>

        <p>Each Driver will automatically be able to accept all jobs suitable for their vehicle and geographic area. If you do not wish to accept any trip type, you are able to edit your preferences from the Driver App.</p>

        <p>Any toll, parking, or congestion charges incurred during the trip will be automatically added to the Passenger fare and will not be included as part of Zippe's fee calculation.</p>

        <h2>Fees</h2>
        <p>In exchange for use of the Software Services, you agree that Zippe will retain a fee from any Fare collected in accordance with clause 9, based on each trip you provide to a Passenger as a result of using the Software ("<strong>Fee</strong>").</p>

        <p>You can verify the applicable Fee Percentage on the Driver App at any time.</p>

        <p>The Fee percentage may change from time to time, but you will be notified prior to any such change. If you do not agree to the change, you must stop providing trips through the Driver App. Your continued use of the app after any such change in the Fee shall be taken as your acceptance of such change.</p>

        <p>Zippe is not entitled to any Fees for fares you earn by providing any Passenger transportation services independently or via another software provider.</p>

        <h2>Payments</h2>
        <p>All payments for trips take place via the Passenger App. You must not ask for, or take, cash payment for completed trips.</p>

        <p>Once you end a trip on the Driver App, Zippe shall invoice the Passenger on your behalf and charge the passenger’s nominated credit or debit card for the amount of the Fare. Zippe will then create a receipt on your behalf setting out the Fare, time, and other relevant information relating to that particular trip.</p>

        <p>The receipt for each trip will be accessible to you on the App. The receipt will also be emailed to the Passenger.</p>

        <p>Zippe shall transfer the amounts collected on your behalf as Fares less the applicable fees and deductions (if any), to your bank account by the end of the week for all trips up to and including those on the previous Sunday up until midnight.</p>

        <p>In the event that you dispute the payment amount, Zippe may withhold the disputed amounts until the dispute has been resolved.</p>

        <p>Without prejudice to clause 11.9, you acknowledge that Zippe shall not be obliged to pay you the payments due from a Fare in the event of non-payment for whatever reason or if the Passenger’s payment failed because the Passenger’s credit card or mobile payment is reversed, cancelled, or is unsuccessful for any reasons not attributable to Zippe. If this occurs, Zippe will help you in requesting the fare due from the Passenger in respect of the Trip. However, if Zippe is unable to collect the fare for whatever reason, Zippe may decide not to pay you a payment or may decide to pay you in whole or in part if it considers it is reasonable to do so. In any event, Zippe will not pay more than £5 per any one Trip for which non-payment occurs. In order to reduce the risk of non-payment, Zippe pre-authorises the Passenger payment at the point of Passenger booking.</p>

        <p>Your payments reports will be made available to you in the Driver App on a daily basis. The reports will show the fares collected in relation to your Trips, as well as the amounts of Zippe's fees.</p>

        <p>Zippe reserves the right to distribute discount codes to Passengers, at their discretion, on a per-promotion basis. You are required to accept the use of a discount code when the Passenger applies the code using the app to book a Trip. If the use of discount codes by a Driver is suspected as being fraudulent, illegal, or in conflict with any of Zippe’s Terms and Conditions relating to discount code use, then the discount code may be cancelled by Zippe and the outstanding amount will not be reimbursed by Zippe to the Driver.</p>

        <p>Without prejudice to clause 11.6, you are responsible for the risk of non-payment of fares for long-distance Trips. Zippe will help you in requesting the fare due from the Passenger for a long-distance Trip in the event of non-payment, and Zippe will transmit a payment to you if the fare is ultimately collected from the Passenger. However, if Zippe is unable to collect the fare from a Passenger after making one attempt to do so, no payment will be made to you in respect of that Trip. In this clause, a “long-distance Trip” means a Trip in excess of 50 miles in distance or one hour in duration.</p>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>As a worker, you are entitled to a number of benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>28 days paid holiday leave</strong>, including bank holidays. This equates to 12.07% of your gross earnings in a week and will be paid weekly.</li>
            <li>Zippe will deduct Income tax and National Insurance contributions from your earnings and will provide the details of your earnings in a pay slip. (“Gross Earnings” are Earnings from Fares, less Zippe Fees or other deductions and before Income tax and NI insurance deductions).</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum hourly wage</strong> as prescribed in The National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 and as set out by Government guidelines from time to time. This will be calculated on a weekly basis and based on the total number of hours worked using time accepting Trip and completion of Trip as a definition of working.</li>
            <li>12 weeks following the completion of your first Trip with Zippe we will auto-enroll you into a NEST pension scheme. As part of this arrangement, you will pay 5% of Gross earnings into the scheme and Zippe will contribute 3%. You will have the option of opting out of this pension arrangement.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>b)</strong> Loss of profit or anticipated savings.</li>
            <li><strong>c)</strong> Loss of business, contracts, contacts, goodwill, reputation, and any loss that may arise from interruption of the business.</li>
            <li><strong>d)</strong> Loss or inaccuracy of data; and</li>
            <li><strong>e)</strong> Any other type of indirect or consequential loss or damage.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Zippe will endeavour to prevent unwelcomed Passengers from using the app. However, Zippe is not liable for the actions of Passengers or their Co-Passengers using the app and/or during any Trips provided. Zippe shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may occur as a result of actions or non-actions of Passengers or their Co-Passengers at any time.</p>

        <p>You are fully responsible and liable for any breach by you of these Driver Terms and/or any other applicable laws or regulations. If Zippe or any authority notifies you of a breach, you must stop and remedy such breach immediately.</p>

        <p>You agree to fully indemnify and hold Zippe, their representatives, employees, and directors harmless from any claims or losses (including liabilities, damages, penalties, fines, costs, and expenses of any nature) that they suffer as a result of your use of the app and provision of Trips, including those claims or losses resulting from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>a)</strong> Your breach of these Driver Terms or documents incorporated by reference.</li>
            <li><strong>b)</strong> Your violation of any law or the rights of a third party, including, without limitation, Passengers, other motorists, and pedestrians, as a result of your interaction with such a third party.</li>
            <li><strong>c)</strong> Any allegation that any materials that you submit to Zippe or transmit through the software infringe or otherwise violate the rights (including intellectual property rights) of any third party.</li>
            <li><strong>d)</strong> Your ownership, use, or operation of a motor vehicle or Passenger vehicle, including the provision of Trips; and/or</li>
            <li><strong>e)</strong> Any other activities in connection with the provision of Trips by you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Personal Data</h2>
        <p>By using the app, you acknowledge that your personal data will be processed in accordance with Zippe's Privacy Policy. For details on how Zippe collects, stores, discloses, and processes your personal data, please refer to our Privacy Policy: <a href="https://nwilson-zippe.github.io/privacy-policy-zippe.github.io/" target="_blank">https://nwilson-zippe.github.io/privacy-policy-zippe.github.io/</a></p>

        <p>Unless we expressly permit you to do otherwise, you shall only use the personal data provided by Passengers or made accessible by the app for the purposes of completing the Passenger’s Trip request in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations.</p>

        <p>Unless communication is initiated at the Passenger’s direct request, or we expressly permit you to do otherwise, you shall only contact a Passenger for the purpose of fulfilling the Passenger’s trip request made via the app, always in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations.</p>

        <h2>Misconduct</h2>
        <p>Without affecting any of Zippe's other rights under these Driver Terms, where Zippe has reasonable grounds to suspect that you have committed, attempted to commit, aided, or abetted a crime, Zippe shall take all steps deemed necessary in the circumstances, including reporting your misconduct to the appropriate authorities. You acknowledge that this may include reporting your conduct to the Police, licensing authority, or any other relevant authority and providing that agency with your details and/or any relevant information Zippe holds about the relevant circumstances. Where the misconduct relates to fraud, including fraudulent documents, Zippe reserves the right to withhold any payments payable to you as a result of fraudulently performing Trips.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>These Driver Terms are effective upon your submission of your registration with Zippe and will continue in full force and effect until terminated by either party in accordance with these Driver Terms.</p>

        <p>You may terminate your relationship with Zippe at any time. Upon termination, the license granted to you is automatically revoked and you must immediately cease use of the Driver App and remove the app from your device.</p>

        <p>Unless otherwise set out in these Driver Terms, Zippe may terminate their relationship with you at any time by giving you at least seven days’ notice in writing.</p>

        <p>Zippe will allow up to three warnings before suspending an account. However, Zippe reserves the right to immediately terminate their relationship with you and block your access to your account (including preventing you from registering a new account) without giving any advance notice if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>a)</strong> You are in breach of these Driver Terms and/or any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
            <li><strong>b)</strong> You provide poor service (as evidenced by passenger complaints and/or ratings) and such poor service standards would, in Zippe's reasonable opinion, bring Zippe and/or the app into disrepute.</li>
            <li><strong>c)</strong> Your badge is revoked; or</li>
            <li><strong>d)</strong> You lost your driving licence.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Upon termination of your relationship with Zippe by any party for any reason, all rights granted to you under these Driver Terms shall cease and you must cease all activities authorised by these Driver Terms. At such time, you must remove the app from your device.</p>

        <h2>Further Provisions</h2>
        <p>These Driver Terms shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.</p>

        <p>You may not assign these Driver Terms or any of the rights or obligations under these Driver Terms.</p>

        <p>You agree that Zippe may assign any of its obligations arising under these Driver Terms to any Affiliate Company.</p>

        <p>Any notice required to be given to you by Zippe will be delivered to the email address associated with your account or sent by registered mail to the address associated with your account, or sent via the Driver App. Any notice required to be given by you to Zippe should be delivered using the Driver App, registered mail to Zippe's office address, or by email to <a href="mailto:support@zippe.co.uk">support@zippe.co.uk</a>.</p>

        <p>If any provision of these Driver Terms is held to be unenforceable, the parties shall substitute for the affected provision an enforceable provision that approximates the intent and economic effect of the affected provision. The failure or delay by either party to enforce any term of the Driver Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such term.</p>

        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>The Zippe app shows Trip destinations before Trip requests are accepted; therefore, Driver cancellation of accepted Trips is prohibited except in exceptional circumstances based on a justifiable explanation provided by the Driver. The Driver shall immediately inform Zippe in case of any cancellation of an accepted Trip. Further, the Driver hereby agrees such cancellation may lead to a Driver cancellation fee.</p>

        <p>In cases where a Trip cancellation results in a 'Driver Cancellation Fee' of £5.00 being charged, Zippe will hold this amount for 3 days. If within these 3 days, Zippe does not receive communication from the Driver with a justifiable explanation as to why the Trip was cancelled by them, the fee charged will be credited to the Passenger who originally requested the Trip which was cancelled.</p>

        <p>The Driver Cancellation Fee is subject to review by Zippe at any time as Zippe deems appropriate. Zippe may amend or remove the Driver Cancellation Fee at any time. Drivers will be made aware of any changes to the Driver Cancellation Fee via the App.</p>

        <p>In the case of a Passenger 'no show' at a specified pick-up point, the Driver can cancel the trip without being charged a 'Driver cancellation fee' after the waiting time has lapsed (between 3 and 5 minutes after arrival depending on the vehicle type). Such cancellation by the Driver will result in the Passenger being charged a Cancellation Fee. A cancellation fee will be passed to the Driver.</p>

        <h2>CCTV</h2>
        <p>As part of your agreement with us, any Driver who makes any use of in-vehicle CCTV is required to notify us of its use and ensure that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is operated in line with any guidelines as set out by the licensing authority that provides your private hire licence.</li>
            <li>You have registered with the ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office) as a Data Controller.</li>
            <li>You comply with the relevant guidance issued by the ICO and the Surveillance Camera Commissioner (SCC), including performing a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).</li>
            <li>Within the relevant vehicle used, there is a clear sign indicating that CCTV is in operation which states the purpose for using the CCTV system, the details of the Data Controller, and the Data Controller ICO Registration Number.</li>
            <li>You verbally advise that CCTV is in operation where necessary, e.g., where people may have visual impairments.</li>
            <li>The system does not record audio at any time.</li>
            <li>Data is stored securely, with access controls to prevent unauthorised access and only shared when lawful.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Where the installation of CCTV is a contractual requirement of a Passenger Transport Contract, Zippe’s Customer is the Data Controller for the recordings produced by the CCTV; therefore, Zippe and Drivers must only act on the Customer's instructions in relation to the handling of personal data collected in this way. Zippe will notify Drivers of any contractual requirements relating to the installation and operation of CCTV in vehicles used on Passenger Transport Contracts.</p>
